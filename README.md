# RJW Illustration Online Portfolio

----

## **Introduction**

Rian Whiteside is an active, industrious Illustrator and digital artist based in the rural South West of the UK. Despite having a *distinctive **style***, *extensive **portfolio*** and *growing **client list***, he ***still** doesn't have a **website!***

#### ***Until now...***

**RJW Illustration** is a site that hopes showcase Rian's unique art style to a wider audience online, in a simple-yet-stylish experience. The site will be targeted toward users who enjoy discovering new artists to follow and artworks to appreciate. 

The **RJW Illustration** site will be useful for users and other artists wishing to see more of Rian's work, and also offer the opportunity to send him a message, enquire about commissions or discuss collaborations.

# UCD Phase 1: STRATEGY 

## PROJECT GOALS

![Initial Project Doodlings](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/pp01_initial_thinx.jpg)

## External User Goals: 

- Viewing original illustrative artwork by RJW
- Basic information & social media links for RJW
- Ability to contact RJW about commissions or collaborations

  Additional ***user expectations*** for consideration include:

  Additional ***stakeholder concerns*** for consideration: 
  - Dark theme with some animated page element(s) preferred; page background/icons/logo
  - Multiple themed galleries rather than all-artworks-in-one
  - Include time-lapse video of digital art process
  - Potential requirement of e-commerce integration at a later date


## Potential Features:

Considering the goals, expectations and concerns detailed above, potential features for the RJW Illustration site should include:
- A stylish and effective design with easy, intuitive navigation - and some animation!
- Multiple thematic galleries of RJW artworks, e.g. Illustrative, Inktober 2020, Portraits, Animals
- Prominent contact methods; social media links, contact form
- 'About' details for RJW including:
  - Short artist bio
  - Video of digital art time-lapse
- Any back-end/preparatory work or features relevant to future e-commerce implimentation

# UCD Phase 2: SCOPE

### Analysis and grading of *Phase One considerations* allows a simple ***Strategy Table*** to be generated:


| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE | IMPORTANCE | VIABILITY/FEASIBILITY | ID    | 
|-----------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|:-------
| Stylish website             | 5          | 5                     | A     |
| Multiple artwork galleries  | 5          | 4                     | B     |
| Prominent contact options   | 5          | 5                     | C     |
| 'About' artist info         | 5          | 5                     | D     |
| E-commerce elements         | 3          | 1                     | E     |
| TOTAL                       | 23         | 20                    |       |


![UCD Strategic Trade-Offs: Importance vs Feasibility](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/uxd_strategic_tradeoffs.jpg)

## Strategic Trade-offs

Plotting the Strategy Table results provides a visible indication of what is feasibily within the scope of the project at this time. As I am unable to meet all requirements at present, I will aim to provide RJW Illustration initially as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product, therefore: 
  Due to time and current-skill limitations (and to also remain close to the number of pages required for this project) the site will be delivered in phases.

  ***Initial Phase:*** Delivery of MVP, a fully functioning website, with the exception of
    
  - E-commerce features/preparations. As a low stakeholder priority, this will follow at a later date as required (and skill levels increase!)
  
  - Initial gallery count of two. Sufficient for proof of concept, subsequent galleries will be added in sunsequent phases.

# UCD Phase 3: STRUCTURE

## Initial **RJW Illustration** Site Map 

Maps generated in [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com) 

![Balsamiq Site Map](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/rjwi_wireframes_desktop/site_map.png)

Prior to generating my wireframes in Balsamiq, I used it's handy Site Map element to better visualise the basic structure and navigation between proposed site pages. 

As with all good wireframes, they are only a guide and subject to change! Amalgamation of pages (following Project Planning session advice from my Mentor - thanks, Marcel!) and project phasing resulted in the final site layout below.

# UCD Phase 5: SURFACE

## DESIGN CHOICES

## Fonts and Icons

All fonts utilised in this project were sourced from and served by [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com)
- **Heading Font:** *Amatic SC*
  
  *Amatic SC* is a cursive style font with an easy-going, hand-rendered feel. In collaboration with stakeholder it was chosen as it effectively compliments the overall aesthetic of both site focus and content.

- **Body Font:** *Open Sans*

  Utilising **Google Fonts** ***popular pairings*** feature, sans-serif font *Open Sans* was chosen from the options for its width and breathing space; a subtle counter to the condensed style of *Amatic*.

![Google Fonts Choices](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/rjwi_fonts.png)

All icons utilised in this project were sourced from and served by [**FontAwesome**](https://fontawesome.com)

## Colours

The 60:40:10 rule was used when determining colours: 
 - **60% Background/Primary:** ***Black*** chosen as a ***stakeholder concern*** - the ultimate dark colour! 
 - **40% Body Text/Secondary:** ***White*** chosen as a perfect compliment to Primary (black) 
 - **10% Accent/Tertiary:** ***Chartreuse*** chosen as a zingy, lively contrast to Primary (black) and ***stakeholder*** preference 

![Colour Choices](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/rjwi_colors.png)

## Imagery

### All site imagery is original copyright material originated and provided by the stakeholder.

## FEATURES

## Site-wide Features

- **Site-wide Header with Logo and Navigation**

![Site-wide Nav & Logo Header Full](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_header.png)

  - Visually balancing the top-left-aligned nav elements, the RJW Illustration logo is rendered top-right using Amatic SC, a cursive web font in a simple, hand-drawn style.
  - Featured on all website pages, the fully responsive header includes links to the Home page, Portfolio landing page and Contact page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.
    - This allows the user to consistently navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  - The example below shows an underline in the site's chosen accent colour, Chartreuse, indicating the current **active** page.


![Header Nav](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_header_nav+home_active.png)

  - ***Shown below:*** On mouse hover and whilst also maintaining the current-page indicator (an underline only), nav links to other pages are highlighted in the site accent colour to provide clear user-feedback, in this case; "click to be taken to Contact page [from the Home page]"

![Header Nav Focus Feedback](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_header_nav_hover_contact.png)
  
- **Site-wide Animated Page Background**

  - The main Home page section consists of an original animated (.mp4) background created by RJW 
    - RJW intends to regularly update the background with fresh animations, encouraging visitors to return and check for new work playing
  - Pages containing copy have been styled with a dark tinted panel behind to reduce contrast between the white copy and underlying animation, this assists users by enhancing contrast and legibility 
  
![Home Page](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_home.png)


- **Site-wide Footer** 

  - The footer section includes links to Instagram and Behance external sites and will open to a new tab, allowing easy navigation for the user. This is valuable to site users as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
  - Additional site-wide breadcrumb-style nav links included in the footer allow easy user navigation to Home, Portfolio and Contact pages at the bottom of long gallery pages and pages on smaller, responsive-styled screens.

![Site-wide Footer](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_footer.png)

![Site-wide Footer Links](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_footer_links.png)

## Home Page Features

- The Home page consists of two responsive elements:
  - ***Left [responsive: top]*** comprises of an 'About' heading above text on dark-tinted panel, containing brief information about RJW, encouraging getting in touch and thanking for visiting. Valuable to user relations as it conveys pertinent information in a friendly, approachable manner
  - ***Right [responsive: bottom]*** a paused and muted time-lapse video of RJW's digital art process for the 'Dizzy' illustration. Valuable to users as it provides an insight into RJW's methods and artistic process. 
    - In the interest of good UXD, THE VIDEO DOES NOT AUTOPLAY until user-invoked, looping thereafter until stopped

## Portfolio Page Features

  - The Portfolio page serves as a landing page providing users with links to themed galleries of work. 
    - This is valuable to the user as it enables them to easily choose between the different thematic styles of illustration RJW creates 
  - Two gallery choices initially available. Flexbox CSS method utilised allows easy addition & styling for subsequent gallery pages as required

![Portfolio](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_portfolio.png)

  - On mouse hover over image a Gallery Title is made visible, indicating which Gallery will be selected when clicked. This has user value as it assists in clear navigation to artworks.

![Portfolio Gallery Title on Image Hover](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_portfolio_gallery-title_hover-trans-2.png)

## Gallery Page Features

  - The gallery provides the visitor with a smooth flow of high-quality RJW artworks. This is valuable to the user as they are be able to easily access and browse the themed galleries of art RJW produces. 
  - A Gallery Title heading of white text upon a dark-tinted background sits immediately below the header, adding value by clearly informing visitors which gallery they are browsing
  - The gallery page is responsive, with @media queries for; 768px and below (1-column); 1024px and below (2-column) and full-screen (3-column). Valuable to users as large, clear images are maintained on medium and small screens.

![Gallery Title Header](readme_media/rjwi_screens_site_features/rjwi_gallery_title_header-trans.png)

![Gallery responses: full/1024/768](#)

  - Additional navigation styled at foot of page, enabling users to switch sideways through galleries, i.e. from one gallery to an adjacent gallery, without having to revisit the Portfolio page. Enriches the user experience by intuitively eliminating unnecessary navigation steps when swapping Gallery.

![Gallery footer links](#)

## Contact Page Features

  - This page exactly matches styling and layout established on the home page, consisting of two responsive elements:
    - ***Left [responsive: top]*** made up of a 'Contact RJW Illustration' heading above text on dark-tinted panel, containing a friendly Call-To-Action encouraging getting in touch, a reiteration of social media links (which open in a new browser tab) and a brief list of services available. Valuable to users as it conveys pertinent information in a friendly, approachable manner.
    - ***Right [responsive: bottom]*** a clear Call-To-Action 'Get in touch!' heading above a simple form element on dark-tinted panel, cheerfully encourages user interaction. Valuable as it provides clear and easy methods to make contact with RJW.  
    - The validated form requires the input of first & last name, email address and a message before the 'Say hullo!' (submit) input activates and allows submission. Adds value as in addition to providing users a means of contact, valid submissions also yield user data for RJW.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- **Further Gallery Pages**

  - 

- **Online webstore**

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Bugs and fixes:

### **Bug:** Header logo breaking apart

! INSERT SCREENSHOT !

**Issue:** During window resizing RJW Illustration logo would split into two lines. 

**Solution:** Googled the issue, found and implemented the following fix:

How to Prevent Word Wrap on a Web Page: HTML Method
If you only have the one-off instance of two or more words that you want to force the browser to keep on a single line, the easiest way is to use the non-breaking space character, "&nbsp;", to separate those words instead of a normal space.

Sourced from: https://www.thesitewizard.com/css/prevent-word-wrapping.shtml September 2021.

### **Bug:** Gallery responsiveness for screens 600px and below

**Issue:** During responsive testing the columns wouldn't flex from two to one when dropping below 600px.

**Solution:** Finally realised the code was good but the CSS styling order wasn't! Moving the '@media...max-width: 992px' query from after/below the '@media...max-width: 600px" query to before/above it in the CSS heirarchy fixed the issue.

### **Bug:** Ugly response layouts at 615px and iPad screen width (768px)

**Issue:**

**Solution:**

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html)
