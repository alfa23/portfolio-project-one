# RJW Illustration Online Portfolio

----

## **Introduction**

Rian Whiteside is an active, industrious Illustrator and digital artist based in the rural South West of the UK. Despite having a *distinctive **style***, *extensive **portfolio*** and *growing **client list***, he ***still** doesn't have a **website!***

#### ***Until now...***

**RJW Illustration** is a site that hopes showcase Rian's unique art style to a wider audience online, in a simple-yet-stylish experience. The site will be targeted toward users who enjoy discovering new artists to follow and artworks to appreciate. 

The **RJW Illustration** site will be useful for users and other artists wishing to see more of Rian's work, and also offer the opportunity to send him a message, enquire about commissions or discuss collaborations.

# UCD Phase 2: SCOPE

### Analysis and grading of *Phase One considerations* allows a simple ***Strategy Table*** to be generated:


| OPPORTUNITY/PROBLEM/FEATURE | IMPORTANCE | VIABILITY/FEASIBILITY | ID    | 
|-----------------------------|:----------:|:---------------------:|:-------
| Stylish website             | 5          | 5                     | A     |

![UCD Strategic Trade-Offs: Importance vs Feasibility](readme_media/rjwi_planning_docs/uxd_strategic_tradeoffs.jpg)

## Strategic Trade-offs

Plotting the Strategy Table results provides a visible indication of what is feasibily within the scope of the project at this time. As I am unable to meet all requirements at present, I will aim to provide RJW Illustration initially as an MVP or Minimum Viable Product, therefore: 
  Due to time and current-skill limitations (and to also remain close to the number of pages required for this project) the site will be delivered in phases.

  ***Initial Phase:*** Delivery of MVP, a fully functioning website, with the exception of
    
  - E-commerce features/preparation. As low priority, this will follow at a later date as required (and skill levels increase!)
  
  - Initial gallery count of two. Sufficient for proof of concept, subsequent galleries will be added in sunsequent phases.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- **Further Gallery Pages**

  - 

- **Online webstore**

## Testing 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Bugs and fixes:

### **Bug:** Header logo breaking apart

! INSERT SCREENSHOT !

**Issue:** During window resizing RJW Illustration logo would split into two lines. 

**Solution:** Googled the issue, found and implemented the following fix:

How to Prevent Word Wrap on a Web Page: HTML Method
If you only have the one-off instance of two or more words that you want to force the browser to keep on a single line, the easiest way is to use the non-breaking space character, "&nbsp;", to separate those words instead of a normal space.

Sourced from: https://www.thesitewizard.com/css/prevent-word-wrapping.shtml September 2021.

### **Bug:** Gallery responsiveness for screens 600px and below

**Issue:** During responsive testing the columns wouldn't flex from two to one when dropping below 600px.

**Solution:** Finally realised the code was good but the CSS styling order wasn't! Moving the '@media...max-width: 992px' query from after/below the '@media...max-width: 600px" query to before/above it in the CSS heirarchy fixed the issue.

### **Bug:** Ugly response layouts at 615px and iPad screen width (768px)

**Issue:**

**Solution:**

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
